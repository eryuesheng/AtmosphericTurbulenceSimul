Simulates effect of atmospheric turbulence on wavefronts at visible and near-\/\+I\+R wavelength. Includes chromatic diffractive propagation between layers, inner, outer scales, wind speed and direction for each layer, C\+N2 profile.

O\+P\+D and scintillation can be computed for multiple wavelengths and multiple directions.

Output can be F\+I\+T\+S files (cubes), or shared memory image for real-\/time use by other programs. In shared memory mode, physical time and computer clock time can be synced, with a one-\/to-\/one match or a slowing down / speeding up factor.

\subsection*{Source Code Architecture}

Written in C. The main is a command line interface (C\+L\+I). Source code is in \hyperlink{CLIcore_8c}{C\+L\+Icore.\+c} and \hyperlink{CLIcore_8h}{C\+L\+Icore.\+h}. Key data structures (such as the image data structure) are declared in \hyperlink{CLIcore_8h}{C\+L\+Icore.\+h}.

\subsection*{How to run the turbulence simulator}

Copy scripts from ./src/\+Atmospheric\+Turbulence/scripts directory to working directory. Edit and execute the main script \char`\"{}runturb\char`\"{}
